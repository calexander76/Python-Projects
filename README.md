# Python-Projects
====== /n
This is a repository for python projects that I have recently started adding to GitHub. 
Several may come from my studies at Georgia Tech in the MS-Quantitative/Computational Finance program, and some are my own development. 
Projects completed in jupyter notebook will also be rendered in HTML for easier viewing.
