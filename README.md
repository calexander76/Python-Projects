# Python-Projects
======  
This is a repository for python projects that I have recently started adding to GitHub. 
Several may come from my studies at Georgia Tech in the MS-Quantitative/Computational Finance program, and some are my own development. 
Analysis projects completed in jupyter notebook that are comments from a particular analysis will also be rendered in HTML for easier viewing.
